First, I\u2019ll go over the dozen ways AI is getting murky, from dodgy marketing to tragedy-of-the-commons slop, Recall privacy violations to bad or delayed demos. But then I\u2019ll touch on over a dozen papers - and real-life deployments, of LLMs, CNNs and more - making the case that we shouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater. Crucially, I'll cover 6 key approaches that are being developed to drag LLMs toward AGI. this video will hopefully, at the very least, leave you much better informed on the current landscape of AI.\n\nAI Insiders: https://www.patreon.com/AIExplained\n\n\nARC-prize: https://arcprize.org/?task=3aa6fb7a\nChatGPT is Bullshit: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5\n\nApple Cook Interview: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/11/tim-cook-apple-interview/\n\nAI Slop: https://taplio.com/generate-linkedin-posts\nhttps://www.npr.org/2024/05/14/1251072726/ai-spam-images-facebook-linkedin-threads-meta\n\nOpenAI Erotica: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/09/openai-considers-allowing-users-to-create-ai-generated-pornography\n\nAI Toothbrush: https://www.oralb.co.uk/en-gb/product-collections/genius-x\n\nRecall Hackable: https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-windows-recall-privilege-escalation/\n\nMurati: \u2018Few Weeks\u2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQacCB9tDaw&t=35s\nMedical Studies: https://x.com/JeremyNguyenPhD/status/1774021645709295840\n\nBeMyEyes Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwNUJ69RbwY\n\nBrainoMix: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296572/\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/artificial-intelligence-revolutionising-nhs-stroke-care\n\nChollet Clips and Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q96eFrtLB8U\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqMcfdzqedE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UakqL6Pj9xo\n\nGartner Hype Cycle: https://s7280.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hype-1024x682.png\n\nJack Cole: https://x.com/Jcole75Cole/status/1787191212144754707\nMethods: https://lab42.global/community-interview-jack-cole/\nhttps://lab42.global/community-model-efficiency/\n\nEnding Animal Testing - GAN: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42933-9\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd110l61r3go\n\nVirtual Rodent: https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1801210428673892496\n\nGoogle AI Overviews: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-overviews-rollback.html\n\nNoam Brown Optimism: https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1801050467381723506\n\nMLC Human-like Reasoning: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06668-3\n\nMany Shot Google Deepmind: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11018\n\nAutomated Process Supervision: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06592\n\nNo Zero-shot Without Exponential Data: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04125\n\nProf. Rao Paper 1: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=X6dEqXIsEW\n\nDrEureka: https://eureka-research.github.io/dr-eureka/\n\nAlphaGeometry: https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/\n\nGraph Neural Networks Joint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09308\n\nTerence Tao: Tacit Data: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-will-become-mathematicians-co-pilot/\n\nMira Murati on Models: https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1801022339162800336\n\nChollet Tweet: https://x.com/fchollet/status/1801780352316518552\n\nNon-hype Newsletter: https://signaltonoise.beehiiv.com/\nGenAI Hourly Consulting: https://www.theinsiders.ai/\n\nNeed an GenAI app built for your business (any scale), in 4-8 weeks?
