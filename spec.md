## Implementation Details

### Key Design Decisions
1. No direct AI API integration to leverage existing subscriptions 
2. Browser-tab based interaction with AI services 
3. Local storage for settings and history 
4. Minimal server-side state 

### AI Integration

#### Default Prompt Template

The prompt structure is designed for optimal AI response based on these principles:
1. **Context First**: Give the AI the content (transcript) before the instructions
2. **Recency Effect**: Place the most important instructions last, as they're more likely to be followed
3. **Clear Separation**: Use clear markers between transcript and instructions
4. **Memory Optimization**: For very long transcripts, key instructions should be repeated after the content

Here's the optimized prompt template:

```
The following is a transcript from a YouTube video. Please analyze it carefully:

[TRANSCRIPT]

---

Based on this transcript, please provide:

1. Summarize the key points and main ideas (2-3 sentences)
2. List the most important insights or takeaways (3-5 bullet points)
3. Identify any new or interesting concepts that were introduced
4. Note any practical applications or action items
5. Suggest 2-3 related topics I might want to learn about next

Please format your response using markdown, with clear headings for each section.
```

Prompt Design Rationale:
- Placing transcript first ensures AI has full context before processing instructions
- Clear separator (---) helps AI distinguish content from instructions
- Instructions are ordered from general to specific
- Formatting request at the end as it's a presentation preference
- For very long transcripts, consider adding a brief instruction before the transcript as well

Alternative for Long Transcripts:
```
Please analyze this YouTube video transcript to help me learn from it.

[TRANSCRIPT]

---

To help me learn from this content, please provide:
[same instructions as above]
```

The system will automatically select the appropriate prompt version based on transcript length.
